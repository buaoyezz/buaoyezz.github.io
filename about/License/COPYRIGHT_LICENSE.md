### 2.2 Commercial Use

Most of the Software is licensed under GPLv3.

For commercial use of the Software, you can notify ZZBuAoYe by email at zzbuaoye@qq.com, and I will allow you to use it without charging any fees.

## 4. Open Source Components

The Software may include components governed by open source licenses. Nothing in this agreement limits your rights under any applicable open source license terms or grants you rights that supersede those terms.
However, even if I discover you violating these terms, I won't take action against you.
But if you make minimal changes to the Software solely for the purpose of reselling it, I do not consent to that.
